# broadreach-hospital
A basic information system for the broadreach hospital (Completed by 15 May 2020) Individual Project:

·         The system was designed to be used by a hospital/clinic. The intention was to simulate an environment whereby patients are registered a profile on the system.

·         Staff members such as the receptionist and Clinicians have the function to make an appointment for the patient.

·         Once an appointment is made, a trigger in the database inserts a message to the relevant staff member, as well as the patient.

·         Staff members can filter patient records.

·         The system was constructed using vanilla PHP and JavaScript, while the database was managed through MySQL.
